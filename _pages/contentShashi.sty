In the post-genomic era, there have been great advances in high-throughput experimental studies. These provide valuable observational data, however, integration of such data will provide a holistic understanding of cellular processes, which usually involve complex dynamic interaction of biological networks. The focus of our group is the development of computational approaches to integrate and analyze biological networks with the long-term applications in the discovery of drug targets and diagnostic markers.

We are interested in generation of comprehensive metabolic pathways by metabolic reconstruction approaches and including new reactions predicted for promiscuous enzymes. For reaction prediction, we will describe each reaction with a molecular descriptor, which can operate on substrate compounds to result in product compounds. A promiscuous reaction is predicted if the reaction operator results in a chemically valid product compounds. The resulting expanded metabolic reaction network will be investigated for the alternative metabolic pathways or for novel bio-transformation pathways. We are also interested in studying the evolutionary perspective of metabolic pathways by aligning these from various organisms and investigate emergence of their metabolic capabilities.

In approach to predict new reactions, a key assumption is that a promiscuous enzyme can accommodate compounds similar to its cognate substrate. To assess and further predict these, we will develop a combined sequence-structure and data mining approaches to predict ligand protein interactions. These prediction is based on reasoning that compounds sharing some similarity should also share targets, and targets sharing similar ligands should have similar binding sites. In machine learning approaches, we will derive conservation patterns between chemical substructures and binding site residues and implement them to predict ligand binding sites. For sequence/structure-based approach, we will develop computational strategies to predict meta-binding sites and consensus set of ligands combining structure-based ligand binding sites. In addition, these tools will also be used for identification of interaction modes of ligands at the families/sub-family level and will be used to suggest lead compound for drug discovery process. These predictions can be enhanced by incorporating knowledge of protein tertiary structures. Towards this, we will perform protein modeling using fragment assembly approach of Threading ASSembly and Refinement (TASSER) using constraints derived from templates with known structures.

2014:
Shashi Bhushan Pandit's research group is interested in un-
derstanding the structural and/or sequence basis of enzyme
promiscuity, ligand-protein interactions and domain interac-
tions in multi-domain proteins with an aim to develop ro-
bust computational prediction methodologies. Microorgan-
isms show remarkable resilience towards deletion of genes
involved in metabolic pathways. Usually, this is attributed
to enzyme’s capability to catalyze alternate substrate/
reaction (promiscuous activity). The metabolic pathway re-
constructions including these promiscuous reactions can pro-
vide comprehensive metabolic capability of an organism.
Recently, using chemoinformatics approach they developed
a method to predict putative promiscuous reactions using
molecular reaction signatures. In this approach, they as-
sumed that enzymes would accommodate any substrate and
catalyze the same. To evaluate this assumption, his group is
engaged in systematic investigation of structural and se-
quence properties of enzymes or substrates binding sites,
which could confer them promiscuity. Furthermore, they
are interested in studying the mechanistic aspect of enzyme
promiscuity and their evolution. In this regard, they are
evaluating the role of protein dynamics in ligand-protein
interactions. Many enzymes are multi-domain proteins.
Hence, to investigate structural roles domain-domain inter-
actions in enzyme promiscuity, his group is developing tools
for tertiary structure prediction of multi-domain proteins
employing our recently developed method TASSER (Thread-
ing ASSembly and Refinement).

2016,2017 Shashi Bhushan Pandit : The main research interest of our group is to understand structural/sequence basis
of enzyme promiscuity, ligand-protein interactions and modeling of multi-domain proteins with an aim to develop
robust computational prediction methodologies. Microorganisms show remarkable resilience towards deletion of
genes involved in metabolic pathways. Usually, this is attributed to enzyme’s capability to catalyze alternate
substrate/reaction (promiscuous activity). Hence, including these promiscuous reactions in metabolic pathway
reconstructions can provide complete metabolic capability of an organism. Recently, using chemoinformatics
approach we have developed a method to predict putative promiscuous reactions using molecular reaction sig-
natures. In this approach, we assumed that enzymes would accommodate any substrate and catalyze the same.
To evaluate this assumption, we are systematically investigating the structural and sequence properties of en-
zymes or substrates binding sites, which could confer them promiscuity. Furthermore, we will investigate the
mechanistic aspect of enzyme promiscuity and study their evolution. In addition to this, we will study the role of
protein dynamics in ligand-protein interactions. Many enzymes are multi-domain proteins. In order to investigate
domain-domain structural roles, we are developing tools for tertiary structure prediction of multi-domain proteins
employing our recently developed method TASSER (Threading ASSembly and Refinement).

The deluge of high-throughput experimental data along with readily available genomic information and protein structures (experimental/modelled) enables large-scale integrative computational analyses to elucidate molecular details of protein functions and/or biological processes. Additionally, it could provide insights into functional landscape of protein or family of proteins. 


The research vision of my group is to understand the role of protein structures in shaping the molecular evolution of protein function(s). In my group, we are engaged in addressing various biologically interesting questions such as to understand the mechanistic basis of enzyme promiscuity, relating spider silk sequences to their mechanical features, single residue mutational affect(s) on allosteric behaviour of proteins, proteome diversity due to alternative splicing, and how intra-domain motions modulate function of proteins.

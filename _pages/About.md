In the post-genomic era, there have been great advances in high-throughput experimental studies. These provide valuable observational data, however, integration of such data will provide a holistic understanding of cellular processes, which usually involve complex dynamic interaction of biological networks. The focus of our group is the development of computational approaches to integrate and analyze biological networks with the long-term applications in the discovery of drug targets and diagnostic markers.

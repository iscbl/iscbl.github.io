purpose:  Proteins are now in focus again, thanks to a flurry of computational prediction by alphafold and same goes for the scarcely focussed aspects of protein computational structural biology. In case you are interested in mechanical understanding of strength impartition in proteins, solving puzzles of what makes or doesn’t protein structure aberrant or susceptible to mutations, designing proteins for new purposes, antibody antigen immunopeptidome interactions,  or domain domain interactive packings, our lab is the place. We source both the knowledge of evolutionarily conservation and state of the art computational biophysical methods for their deal. Skills learnt/acquired in the lab, will be helpful to you for continuing your career in either academia or industry.

eligibility:  If you have keen interest in biology, irrespective of the background you are welcome in the lab. Computational skills are least important and can be acquired in a month or two if you are disciplined and know how to click a mouse. Real talent we need is to interpret the generated data. 

location: The campus has one of the best reach to nearby transport central hubs, we are ~3 km away from Mohali railway station (SASN), ~8 km from Chandigarh Airport and adjoins Chandigarh (The City Beautiful), we are only a few hours away from hills queen Shimla and cherish the festivity all year around in our campus. 

lab: The lab provides ambient enviornment for research with everyone having their own personal seating space in spacious cubicle. There is provision for relaxing space because sitting task can be tiring. There is regular group discussion and group research meeting. The group leader is available for discussions.

The group webpage of Dr Shashi B. Pandit was made with an effort by current students. Our lab is located in 3TL2, Academic Block 2, IISER Mohali. 

We are interested in addressing research problems using computational approaches. We do collaborative research with experimental research groups. In the group, our work encompasses but not limited to area of computational biophysics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metagenomics. All of the above “omics“ approaches are unique in the way that we often modify the traditional approach by sourcing knowledge of “protein structures”.

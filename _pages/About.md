purpose:  Proteins are now in focus again, thanks to a flurry of computational prediction by alphafold and same goes for the scarcely focussed aspects of protein computational structural biology. In case you are interested in mechanical understanding of strength impartition in proteins, solving puzzles of what makes or doesn’t protein structure aberrant or susceptible to mutations, designing proteins for new purposes, antibody antigen immunopeptidome interactions,  or domain domain interactive packings, our lab is the place. We source both the knowledge of evolutionarily conservation and state of the art computational biophysical methods for their deal. Skills learnt/acquired in the lab, will be helpful to you for continuing your career in either academia or industry.

eligibility:  If you have keen interest in biology, irrespective of the background you are welcome in the lab. Computational skills are least important and can be acquired in a month or two if you are disciplined and know how to click a mouse. Real talent we need is to interpret the generated data. 

location: the campus has one of the best reach to nearby transport central hubs, we are ~3 km away from Mohali railway station (SASN), ~8 km from Chandigarh Airport and adjoins Chandigarh (The City Beautiful), we are only a few hours away from hills queen shimla and cherish the festivity all year around in our campus. 

lab: We care needs of isolated space and timely interactions and for the same reasons you will see a personal space oriented open cubicle organization in the lab (6 occupied, 4 left). Sitting jobs can be tiring and during need of prolonged focussed work, there's also a couch to save the lower back (this website was actually designed on a couch). PI is available for your doubts during office hours and regular weekly meetings are also scheduled for research progression.

This is the lab webpage of Dr Shashi Pandit, an effort made by current students. We are located in 3TL2, Academic Block 2, IISER Mohali. There are three labs by that name, ours is technically the middle one. 

Talking about the research direction, we believe in doing collaborations and also independent research, which will also be reflective in our detailed projects page. Work done in the lab is often computational that encompasses but not limited to disciplines of computational biophysics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metagenomics. All of the above “omics“ approaches are unique in the way that we often modify the traditional approach by sourcing knowledge of “protein structures”.

- title: P1 - One gene multiple protein conundrum.
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: One of the major challenges in current understanding of central dogma is perceiving and transitioning from “one gene one protein” paradigm to “one gene multiple protein” one. For instance, the number of genes in human or higher eukaryotes represent only a fraction of proteins expressed. The proteome diversity is aided at multiple levels and equally regulated via processes known as alternative transcription initiation/termination, alternative translation sites, alternative splicing, post translational modification and many more. These processes in general provide phenotypic complexity and are very impactful in different stages of organism life, proxy of which can be inferred by tremendous cost implied with their misregulation in the form of genetic and regulation altered diseases. In our lab we are trying to solve problems of such a scale by using both bottom up and top down approaches. We are trying to leverage our knowledge of protein structures and their mechanism of action (bottoms up) with the broader scale of genome wide loci contributing maximally to such diversities (top down). we hereby are interested in the following aspects of this problem

      dogma: "proteogenomics"
      description:
        - quantifying the functional alternative splicing events (experimental mass spec and rna seq integration)
        - systematic characterization of such events from the perspective of altered protein sequences.
        - measuring the impact of gene-pieces (exons) on functional protein regions.
        - intersection of protein conservation and regions of alternation and their plastic behavior.

      conclusion: We believe that knowledge and information generated from above will help us design “natural intelligence” inspired proteins. Further, such knowledge also has an impact in knowing the regions of protein amenable for modifications and regions which are not, and will have translation to therapeutic advances.

- title: P2 - Materiomics driven learning of silk design principles and strength attributes.
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: “Mimicry” is the most advanced form of inspiration and involves applying engineering and technological tools to develop materials akin to those found in nature with the prime objective of achieving sustainability. One of such natural materials are protein-based biopolymer fibers that we call silk and it possesses exceptional mechanical properties. There have been several attempts to mimic the molecular assembly of silk protein on an industrial scale, yet it remained challenging owing to a lack of complete understanding of design principles relating silk sequence to its structural properties. Silk fiber owes its extraordinary mechanical strength to the hierarchical arrangement of laminated antiparallel β-sheet nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix composed of predominantly short stretches of regular or nonregular secondary structures. The key to silk fiber strength lies in β-sheet nanocrystals. In our lab, we are interested in the following-
      dogma: "Materiomics"
      description:
        - Integrative structural modeling- silk being fibrous protein, involves its own challenges for fair deal to varied experimental approaches. However, parts and separate regions of silk have been detailed by modified NMR and fibro-diffraction measurements. The challenge is to carefully screen and extract from literature such molecular variables and model in-silico. 
        - A detailed dynamics driven study of the resulting model will help us provide insights into the interaction between the strength imparting beta sheet nanocrystals and matrix of disordered regions. Careful dynamics of such regions are yet to be detailed and they may  supposedly be the key to unlock the mechanism of multiple physical attributes that silk fiber possess.
        - structural geometry evolution of the beta sheet nanocrystals- In our recent publication, we have explored the impact of beta sheet favoring residues on silk beta sheet crystal topology and packing. However, possible packing varieties that they could have adopted de-novo, were not emphasized. It would also be interesting to perform such experiments and compare them to aggregation prone amyloid fibrils, by choosing and comparing from frame of reference of their shared structural signatures of polar and steric zippers.
      conclusion: The above project and studies will compensate for reducing the structural gap between the strength design attributes and protein quaternary organization. We believe that this will provide insights into the under-appreciated role of maintaining quaternary and tertiary packing efficiency while designing materiomics driven protein fibers and design units. Work is largely performed in collaboration with the femtosecond lab (Dr. KP singh, IISER-M) .

- title: P3 - Understanding enzyme promiscuity (Preeti, Deeksha).
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: Substrate promiscuity is the ability of (some) enzymes to catalyze alternate substrate(s) other than its native one. It is widely studied for its biotechnological applications and understanding enzyme evolution. Insights into the structural basis of substrate promiscuity would greatly benefit the design and engineering of enzymes. Previous studies on some enzymes have suggested that flexibility, hydrophobicity, and active site protonation state could play an important role in enzyme promiscuity. However, it is not known yet whether substrate promiscuous enzymes have distinctive structural characteristics compared to specialist enzymes, which are specific for a substrate. In pursuit to address this, we have systematically compared active site structural features of promiscuous with those of specialist enzymes and found them to be quite similar. We also proposed that substrate promiscuity could be defined as a continuum feature that varies from narrow (specialist) to broad range of substrate preferences. In addition to above we are interested in following-

      dogma: "Enzyme specificity"
      description:
        - If structure doesn't then what dictates the segregation between promiscuous and specialist enzymes ?
        - As functional conservation of such enzymes are debatable ( in different organisms), what dictates enzymes to adapt in those roles and why? Is there a presence of allosteric regulation via hidden cryptic binding sites or change in interaction partners in different organisms or both ?
        - Predicting promiscuous and specialist enzymes and modeling their impact on microbial stress / altered conditions using flux balance analysis (see FBA project down below page)., 
        
      conclusion: Information and observations gained from above analysis will help not only knowing more details about enzymes but also enhance their commercial application, which if can be tuned allosterically by mimicking what triggers promiscuity/specialty may provide tremendous biotechnological wealth. Moreover, this also holds promising value in modeling gut microbiome and metabolite interactions, where detailed impacts of such promiscuous activities have yet to be studied.

- title: P4 - Study of intrachain domain interfaces and its implication in protein structure modeling.
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: Domains are conserved sequence or structural regions of a protein, often capable of folding and existing on their own in an aqueous solution. They can be described as structural and functional units of a protein. Having multiple domains in protein facilitates complex biological function as well as enhances its efficiency by providing scaffold for functional modules. Over 80% of the eukaryotic genome codes for multidomain proteins. This abundance of multi domain proteins adds complexities for fair resolution/accuracy of protein structure prediction methods. Though deep learning models are performing par excellence, their detailed performance on these sets are yet to be elucidated. Even domain boundary delineation in the majority of cases depends on the folded structure. Hereby we are interested in following aspects-
      dogma: "proteogenomics"
      description:
        - Physiological properties of intra-chain domain domain properties (within a same protein), their evolutionary conservation, and interaction interfaces.
        - Reducing 3D degrees of freedom to interactable poses between two domains by incorporating information from above and their interaction interfaces.
        - Understanding the structural mechanism of functionality preservation in cases of domain atrophy and domain regional loss.

- title: P5 - Mutational effects in proteins.
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: Single residue mutations (SRM) in protein can cause a wide range of functional and structural effects that vary from no change to a complete loss of protein function/structure. In the past, several large scale systematic studies have been performed to decipher consequences of SRM on protein structure and/or function attributed to impairment of stability, defective interactions with other biomolecules (ligand/proteins), and residue packing density. We study the perturbations caused by SRMs in protein structure and the changes in residue interactions accompanied by these variations using the latest state of the art prediction tools. Through these studies, we have explored whether changes in residue interaction networks can explain the functional shift in proteins. hereby we are interested in doing the following.
      dogma: "proteogenomics"
      description:
        - Correlating the effect of mutation ( or severity of disease) with change in protein structure. We employ network centrality approaches,  protein energetic networks and the overall change in protein fold wrt to native form to quantify these
        - Studying in detail the impact of mutation on protein structure- as structure dictates function (still for many of the proteins), what causes the impaired functionality at level of proteins ?
        - The effect of mutation can be local or global (even more so it can be epistasis), or it may also change the folding pathway or its conformational equilibrium (alternative possible structures), what really makes proteins amenable to such changes ?, we employ both evolutionmarily and both computational biophysical approaches for such detailed elucidation. 
      conclusion: For instance, one very common disease, the cholera, still re-emerges in patches around the world and as per CDC stats, 1.3 to 4 million are still getting infected and 21K to 143K die from it per annum. The strains responsible expresses an arsenal of virulent factors that lyse host immune cells and interfere with gut's water retention capabilities. We in our recent collaboration with Dr. Chattopadhyay's lab has found that certain functional mutants of VCC, render it impractical for its possible transition to become active. Future work will explore conservation of these such protein units and possible mechanistic explanations of what renders them inactive and will suggest likely drug targets.

- title: P6 - Protein - Ligand docking.
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: Computational docking is an invaluable tool when it comes to identifying interactions of protein and ligands. A typical docking protocol starts with a structure (solved or modeled) of a known target. A ligand is then docked onto this structure to predict its bound conformation (commonly referred to as pose) and binding free energy. These ligands could be substrates in case of enzymes, where docking can help us in deciphering the fit of substrate in the binding pocket of enzyme. Alternatively, it can also help in identifying the small molecules (inhibitors) which could irreversibly bind the sites (either active or allosteric) of proteins, rendering them ineffective in their molecular function.  Molecular docking aids a lot in identifying lead molecules for the drug discovery by screening through libraries of small molecules thus filtering the potential candidates. This in silico process saves a lot of time and resources. Knowledge of binding site serves as an extra advantage in this process. In the absence of information about the binding site, molecular docking is supplemented by identification of druggable pockets either through blind docking or protein cavities/ cryptic pockets identification.

- title: P1 - Tracing protein’s evolutionary fingerprints - protein sequence/structural phylogenetics.
  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: Insights from protein structures, their topology and internal organization, and conservation can also be used to define inter family relationships among protein groups. For instance, we have done the functional annotation of γ-Glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) [preeti-thesis, chapter 4] which is known as  popularly known as the “mother of all antioxidants”. GCL enzymes from prokaryotes and eukaryotes are classified into Group 1 (mostly γ-proteobacteria), Group 2 (non-plant eukaryotes) and Group 3 (mostly plants and α-proteobacteria). Despite insignificant sequence similarity among these groups, GCL groups are homologs to each other as suggested by significant  similarity and conservation of sequence motifs. This study dives deep into the origin and evolution of the three GCL groups and suggests that γ-glutamyl cysteine may serve a similar role as glutathione in ancestral prokaryotes and glutathione biosynthesis evolved later in evolution. To perform this we have performed sequence alignment using major secondarys structure segments and the literature annotated motifs. Similarly, such methods and refined alignments have been used to.

  type: time_table 
  contents:
    - body: Knowledge of catalytic residues can play an essential role in elucidating mechanistic details of an enzyme. However, experimental identification of catalytic residues is a tedious and time-consuming task, which can be expedited by computational predictions. Despite significant development in active-site prediction methods, one of the remaining issues is ranked positions of putative catalytic residues among all ranked residues. In order to improve ranking of catalytic residues and their prediction accuracy, we have developed a meta-approach based method CSmetaPred. In this approach, residues are ranked based on the mean of normalized residue scores derived from four well-known catalytic residue predictors. The mean residue score of CSmetaPred is combined with predicted pocket information to improve prediction performance in meta-predictor, CSmetaPred_poc. Considering residues ranked ≤20 classified as true positive in binary classification, CSmetaPred_poc achieves prediction accuracy of 0.94 on CSAMAC dataset. Moreover, on the same dataset CSmetaPred_poc predicts all catalytic residues within top 20 ranks for ~73% of enzymes.

- title: P9 - Metabolic networks through FBA.
  type: time_table
  contents:
    - body: Genome Scale Models are metabolic network reconstructions of a target organism, built using all the existing knowledge about that organism, assembled in the form of a stoichiometric matrix on which various mathematical operations are performed to predict the metabolic phenotypes of the target organism under different genotypic or environmental perturbations (in our case, various growth medias). It has been proven in multiple studies in the past that a micro-organism like E. coli strives to grow even under extreme stress, either genetic or environment. This ability of E. coli to adapt to these stressful conditions comes from its ability to rewire its metabolism, in order to make all the essential metabolites that it needs to survive. This metabolic rewiring ensures the presence of certain essential components in the cell, irrespective of the path or metabolic route, taken to produce it. These unconventional routes adopted by the cell are termed as alternate pathways. Performing FBA on these genome scale metabolic models enables us to identify such alternate pathways which can compensate for a particular stress. Conversely, cross validation of experimental data on these genome scale metabolic models helps in their configuration, so that they could serve as a true proxy of model organism. This back and forth information flow between experiments and metabolic modelling has enabled the in silico testing of gene deletions. Traditionally FBA is defined for the system of liquid culture, as the modeling assumes the system to be in a state of equilibrium with a uniform distribution of resources. We have explored this predictive ability of FBA on to the solid cultures, reasoning that these solid cultures experiments are also replicated in liquid cultures. Conflicts in a few cases can easily be resolved by fixing the metabolic routes.
